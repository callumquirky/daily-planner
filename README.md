# daily-planner

## Description

A daily work day planner, for effective time management and higher productivity. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and moment.js.

The app has functionality, so that the colours of the text blocks change colour depending on the time of day, so that the user can seamlessly keep track of their times and tasks with one quick glance. They turn grey for the past, salmon for the present, and green for the future.

Local storage is utilised so that tasks and to-dos will persist on the page even after it has been refreshed. 

In addition to this, when the user saves their tasks a confirmation message will appear at the top of the screen that will disappear after 4.5 seconds.
